# Customer Segmentation and Behavior Analysis Based on Web Usage Data

## Overview
This project analyzes user behavior data from web-based shopping platforms (e.g., InstaCart) to perform customer segmentation and predict purchasing trends. By categorizing users based on their shopping habits, personalized marketing strategies and efficient recommendation systems can be developed. 

The dataset used in this project contains anonymized data about users, products, and their order histories. Several machine learning algorithms are applied to segment customers, predict purchasing tendencies, and analyze relationships between products.

## Project Objective
The goal of this project is to:
- **Analyze user behavior** using web-based shopping data.
- **Segment customers** based on their shopping habits and predict their purchasing behaviors.
- **Develop personalized marketing strategies** and improve recommendation systems for e-commerce platforms.

---

## Dataset
The **InstaCart Online Grocery Basket Analysis Dataset** will be used for this project. It contains data about previous orders, product categories, and user interactions on an e-commerce platform.

### Dataset Files:
- `aisles.csv`: Information about aisles where products belong.
- `departments.csv`: Information about the departments to which products belong.
- `order_products__prior.csv`: Products purchased in prior orders.
- `order_products__train.csv`: Products in the training set for model training.
- `orders.csv`: Order information (e.g., timestamps, user data).
- `products.csv`: Information about the products (e.g., name, price, category).

### Data Types:
- Structured data (numerical, categorical)
- Customer interaction data
- Purchase history

## Methodology

### Data Preprocessing
Before applying machine learning algorithms, we perform essential preprocessing steps:
- **Handle missing values** (e.g., using mean filling or SMOTE for imbalanced data).
- **Convert categorical data** to numerical format using **One-Hot Encoding** or **Label Encoding**.
- **Time-based analysis** to identify trends such as purchase frequency over time.

### Algorithms Used
- **K-Means Clustering:** For customer segmentation.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** For instance-based classification.
- **Random Forest and XGBoost:** Tree-based algorithms for classification tasks (e.g., predicting product purchases).
- **DBSCAN:** Density-based clustering for identifying patterns in data with varying densities.
- **Apriori Algorithm:** Association rule mining for uncovering frequent product pairs.

### Evaluation Metrics
- **Classification:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score.
- **Clustering:** Silhouette Score.
- **Additional Metrics:** Confusion Matrix, ROC-AUC, Execution Time, Memory Usage.

### Analysis and Visualization
- **Customer Segments:** 2D clustering plots.
- **Predictions:** Confusion matrices, ROC curves.
- **Association Rules:** Heatmaps or tables.
- **Performance Comparison:** Visual comparisons of runtime and memory usage for each algorithm.

## GUI (Streamlit)
A user-friendly, web-based **Streamlit** interface will allow users to:
- Upload datasets in CSV format.
- Select and configure algorithms for clustering, classification, and association rule mining.
- View results in graphical or tabular form.
- Compare the performance of different algorithms based on metrics like accuracy, runtime, and memory usage.
